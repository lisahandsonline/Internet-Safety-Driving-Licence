# Internet-Safety-Driving-Licence
## WELCOME to our Repository!  This is where we will build and share our curriculum and learning resources for the Internet Safety Driving Licence.  

The Internet Safety Driving Licence is an *open source online modular short course* built to empower young people (aged 13+) to use the Internet ethically, safely &amp; securely: to live, play &amp; work well online.

Think of it as a kind of **Cyber-Ed**: 5 modules comprising a formal online programme that will prepare a learner to sit the final Internet Safety Driving Test.

Successful completion of all 5 **Cyber-Ed** modules by a learner will lead to the award of a full *Internet Safety Driving Licence*.
